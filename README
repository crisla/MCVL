README

This code will clean the MCVL-CDF afiliation files (2004-2013), joining the different affiliation
files into a single panel. It also links them with personal and pension files.
An extension of the code cleans the fiscal (tax) file and joins it with the master afilaition file.

At the same time, some code offers the posibility of building a quarterly/monthly panel as in the LFS.
Details about this and the code in the robustness folder can be found in Lafuente(2019).

* There will be a new version, where the MCVL is used restrospectively, soon *

In order to work, you will have to fill in the folders in rawfiles with the decompressed
afiliation, pension, and personal information files. The codes work with their original names
except for 2009-2013 where you need to make the .TXT at the end of the file .txt (lowercase)

The code comes in 2 flavours, depending on your purposes. The order of the files should be:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

FLAVOUR A. You want to link to wage data / not interested in building a panel as in the LFS

1. format_all_personal.do  -> This will create a personal .dta file in each year
2. format_all_pension.do   -> This will create a pension .dta file in each year

3. format_all.do           -> This will create an afiliation .dta file in each year

4. Patchwork.do            -> This will join the afiliation files and perform extra corrections

5. format_all_fiscal.do    -> This will create a wages/income .dta file in each year
6. panel_fiscal.do         -> This will merge all wage files and arrange them into a panel

7. merge_fiscal.do         -> This will merge the afiliation panel/file with the wage panel

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

FLAVOUR B. You want to buil as in the LFS. This replicates the results of Lafuente(2019)

1. format_all_personal.do  -> This will create a personal .dta file in each year
2. format_all_pension.do   -> This will create a pension .dta file in each year

3. format_all.do           -> This will create an afiliation .dta file in each year

4. Patchwork_prelim.do     -> This will join the afiliation files and perform extra corrections

5. Patchwork_stu.do /      |
   Patchwork_ltu.do /      |-> Choose your unemployment correction. It will export a series of 
   Patchwork_none.do       |   quarterly stocks and flows like in the LFS in .log files

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
Notes:
* If you want a year in particular (say 2013), you can select it in the format_all files.
* Inside Patchwork.do you can choose with unemployment expansion to implement.
  Simply comment and uncomment the required line of code.
* The contract modification adjustment (cma) and expansion files will work with the panel version.
  If you want to use one year in particular, the code to do so will be available soon.
* I export labour market flows and stocks as .log files. Feel free to write something more sophisticated.
* The quartely_panel and monthly_panel .do files create a labour force state "0" when
  the unemployed is not registered. This happens if the ltu or the stu corrections are implemented.
  If you would prefer to keep all unemployed as "U", modify the state variable to reflect it.
* Using the information on the fiscal file guide, you can investigate different types of income,
  such as royalties, severance payments and more. Edit format_all_wages.do for this.
* If you are willing to sacrifice accuracy for covering more spells, you can use the contribution
  files to get information on the base wages of workers. I do not have the code for this.
* The robusness folder cotains code to perform robustness checks to the unemployment expansions,
  as explained in Lafuente(2019). I have not tested this code in the GitHub version, so there
  might be errors if you try to fun the files. Executing Patchwork_prelim.do is necessary.

If you have any questions, comment on GitHub! Also feel free to email me.

Please do not distribute this code without permission.
