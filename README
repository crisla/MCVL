README

This code will clean the MCVL files and will arrange them into a panel like the LFS.
If you don't want a panel, for now I will recommend you to use the last year of your sample.

In order to work, you will have to fill in the folders in rawfiles with the decompressed
afiliation, pension, and personal information files. The codes work with their original names
except for 2009-2013 where you need to make the .TXT at the end of the file .txt (lowercase)

Then the order of the files should be:

1. format_all_personal.do  -> This will create a personal .dta file in each year
2. format_all_pension.do   -> This will create a pension .dta file in each year

3. format_all.do           -> This will create an afiliation .dta file in each year

4. Patchwork.do            -> This will join the afiliation files and perform extra corrections

5. format_all_fiscal.do    -> This will create a wages/income .dta file in each year
6. panel_fiscal.do         -> This will merge all wage files and arrange them into a panel

7. merge_fiscal.do         -> This will merge the afiliation panel/file with the wage panel

Notes:
* If you want a year in particular (say 2013), you can select it in the format_all files.
* Inside Patchwork.do you can choose with unemployment expansion to implement.
  Simply comment and uncomment the required line of code.
* Patchwork can work as a way to format only one year instead of multiple years.
  Simply uncomment the option that doesn't have a _panel bit in the industry
  and contract modification adjustment (cma) lines.
* I have a very crude way to export the flows into text files. Feel free to write something more sophisticated.
* The quartely_panel and monthly_panel .do files create a labour force state "0" when
  the unemployed is not registered. This happens if the ltu or the stu corrections are implemented.
  If you would prefer to keep all unemployed as "U", modify the state variable to reflect it.
* Using the information on the fiscal file guide, you can investigate different types of income,
  such as royalties, severance payments and more. Edit format_all_wages.do for this.
* If you are willing to sacrifice accuracy for covering more spells, you can use the contributions
  files to get information on the base wages of workers. I do not have the code for this.

If you have any questions, fell free to email me.

Please do not distribute this code without permission.
